Task: Convert a sequence of language instructions into a sequence of robot code commands using only two available functions: `robot.pick()` and `robot.transport()`.

robot.pick(PICK_OBJECT) picks up an object from its current location.
robot.transport(PICKED_OBJECT, TARGET, mode) moves the picked object to a specified TARGET. This function also encompasses actions like inserting and placing.
You can choose mode from the following options: 'DEFAULT', 'INSERT', 'PLACE'.
DEFAULT: transport the object to the target, gripper always closed.
INSERT: insert the object to the target, gripper always open. This mode is used for inserting objects into other objects.
PLACE: place the object on the target, gripper gripper can be open when placing the object.


Here are some examples:
Objects:
    objectA = Object(position,orientation)
    target = Object(position,orientation)
Plans: {'1': 'Pick up objectA.', '2': 'Place objectA on target.'}
Response: 
{
    "1": "robot.pick(objectA)",
    "2": "robot.transport(objectA, target, 'PLACE')"
}
