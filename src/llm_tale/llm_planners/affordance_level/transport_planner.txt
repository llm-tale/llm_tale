The robot is performing a task to achieve a high-level goal, which requires transporting the object to a specific location. 
The object must be aligned correctly with the target position and orientation.

Knowledge Base:
You should use object-centric representation to determine the alignment of the object with the target object.
Orientation:
    DEFAULT: Use this orientation when the object's orientation is not specified or is not critical. The robot gripper will adopt a default orientation.
    TRANSLATION: The robot gripper maintains the object's original orientation. This is used when there is no need for a specific placement orientation or when the object connect to the environment with a joint (e.g., a door handle). In such cases, the object is picked up and placed without changing its orientation.
    ABSOLUTE_VERTICAL: The vertical axis of the world.
To describe the Object's Orientation:
    z_axis: The height axis of the object.
    major_axis: The longest axis in the x, y plane of the object.
    minor_axis: The shortest axis in the x, y plane of the object,usually align with the Gripper y-axis(direction for gripper open/close).
    plane_vertical: The vertical axis of the object's plane.
Transportation axis: 
    the axis the robot is approaching the placement position. normally from the from the top for placing, None for reaching.


Examples:

Instruction: place the cube in the drawer.
Objects:
    CubeA = Object(position,orientation=None)
    drawer = Object(position,orientation=None)
Comments: no orientation is provided, so use default orientation for the gripper. It is a place task, so the transportation axis is ABSOLUTE_VERTICAL(from the top).
RESPONSE:
{
    "CubeA.centroid": "drawer.centroid",
    "orientation": "DEFAULT"
    "transportation axis": "ABSOLUTE_VERTICAL"
}

INPUT: the robot's task is to place the box vertically in the fridge.
Objects:
    detergent_bottle = Object(position,orientation) # bottle is standing
    fridge = Object(position,orientation)
Comments: To place vertically, the z_axis of the object should be aligned with the ABSOLUTE_VERTICAL. For placing the object in the fridge, robot should goes from the front, so the transportation axis is fridge.plane_vertical. As the z_axis already aligns with ABSOLUTE_VERTICAL, we should deside the axis in horizontal plane, normally the longer axis in that plane-major_axis should align with plane_vertical of the fridge.
RESPONSE:
{
    # position
    "detergent_bottle.centroid": "fridge.centroid",
    # orientation
    "detergent_bottle.z_axis": "ABSOLUTE_VERTICAL",
    "detergent_bottle.major_axis": "fridge.plane_vertical"
    # transportation axis
    "transportation axis": "fridge.plane_vertical",
}

INPUT: the robot's task is to place the book horizontally in the shelf.
Objects:
    book = Object(position,orientation)
    shelf = Object(position,orientation)
Comments: To place horizontally, the z_axis of the object should be aligned with the shelf.plane_vertical. For placing the object in the shelf, robot should goes from the front, so the transportation axis is shelf.plane_vertical.
RESPONSE:
{
    # position
    "book.centroid": "shelf.centroid",
    # orientation
    "book.z_axis": "shelf.plane_vertical",
    "book.major_axis": "ABSOLUTE_VERTICAL"
    # transportation axis
    "transportation axis": "shelf.plane_vertical",
}

INPUT: place the USB in the USB port.
Objects:
    USB = Object(position,orientation
        attributes=[head,end] # for USB major_axis is the centerline
    )
    USB_port = Object(position,orientation)
Comments: USB head should be aligned with the USB port. The centerline of the USB should be aligned with the centerline of the USB port. The minor_axis of the USB should be aligned with the minor_axis of the USB port in order to insert the USB correctly.The robot should approach the USB port through the centerline, so the transportation axis is USB_port.major_axis.
RESPONSE:
{
    # position
    "USB.head": "USB_port.centroid",
    # orientation
    "USB.major_axis": "USB_port.major_axis",
    "USB.minor_axis": "USB_port.minor_axis",
    # transportation axis
    "transportation axis": "USB_port.major_axis",
}

INPUT: transport pen to the target.
Objects:
    pen = Object(position,orientation)
    target = Object(position,orientation)
Comments: This is a reaching task, so orientation is TRANSLATION and the transportation axis is None. The pen should be aligned with the target position.
RESPONSE:
{
    # position
    "pen.centroid": "target.centroid",
    # orientation
    "orientation": "TRANSLATION",
    # transportation axis
    "transportation axis": "None",
}

INPUT: open the cupboard handle to the target position.
Objects:
    cupboard = Object(position,orientation,
        attributes=[handle]
    )
    target = Object(position,orientation)
Comments: As handle is have connect to the environment with a joint, so the orientation is TRANSLATION. The cupboard handle should be aligned with the target position. It is a reaching task, so the transportation axis is None.
RESPONSE:
{
    # position
    "cupboard.handle": "target.centroid",
    # orientation
    "Orientation': "TRANSLATION",
    # transportation axis
    "transportation axis": "None",
}

Instructions for Responding:
1. First, analyze how to complete the task based on the provided instructions and object information. Write this reasoning in Comments.
2. Then, provide the final gripper position and orientation in the RESPONSE section.
